    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="post-content">
        <p>Welcome to <em>Field Notes</em>, I’m Giorgio.</p>
<p>By day, I’m an engineering executive, but this space is my digital &quot;field notebook&quot; for the things that don't always
fit into a slide deck or a Jira ticket.</p>
<p>I’ve spent over 15 years navigating the worlds of tech and data.
My career path has been a bit of an evolution: I started out in a lab with a PhD in Computational Chemistry,
co-founded a drug discovery startup, and eventually traded test tubes for distributed systems and microservices.</p>
<h2>What I Do (The &quot;Serious&quot; Version)</h2>
<p>Currently, I’m a Head of Engineering at Zalando, where I lead the Global Catalog department. I spend a lot of my time thinking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scaling Organizations: Growing teams while trying to keep things human and efficient.</li>
<li>Architecture at Scale: Building event-driven systems that can handle millions of articles across European markets.</li>
<li>Strategic Alignment: Helping bridge the gap between &quot;cool tech&quot; and &quot;actual business value&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Why &quot;Field Notes&quot;?</h2>
<p>In science, field notes are where you record raw observations, messy data, and the occasional &quot;eureka&quot; moment.
In leadership and engineering, it’s much the same. This blog is where I document my observations on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The transition from Individual Contributor to Executive.</li>
<li>Navigating complex organizational changes (and surviving them).</li>
<li>Leadership, hard lessons and advices for my future self.</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m based in Dublin, fueled by coffee, and always curious about how to build better systems—both technical and human.</p>
