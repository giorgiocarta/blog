Welcome to _Field Notes_, I’m Giorgio. 

By day, I’m an engineering executive, but this space is my digital "field notebook" for the things that don't always 
fit into a slide deck or a Jira ticket.

I’ve spent over 15 years navigating the worlds of tech and data. 
My career path has been a bit of an evolution: I started out in a lab with a PhD in Computational Chemistry, 
co-founded a drug discovery startup, and eventually traded test tubes for distributed systems and microservices.

## What I Do (The "Serious" Version)
Currently, I’m a Head of Engineering at Zalando, where I lead the Global Catalog department. I spend a lot of my time thinking about:

- Scaling Organizations: Growing teams while trying to keep things human and efficient.
- Architecture at Scale: Building event-driven systems that can handle millions of articles across European markets.
- Strategic Alignment: Helping bridge the gap between "cool tech" and "actual business value".


## Why "Field Notes"?
In science, field notes are where you record raw observations, messy data, and the occasional "eureka" moment. 
In leadership and engineering, it’s much the same. This blog is where I document my observations on:

- The transition from Individual Contributor to Executive.
- Navigating complex organizational changes (and surviving them).
- Leadership, hard lessons and advices for my future self. 

I’m based in Dublin, fueled by coffee, and always curious about how to build better systems—both technical and human.
