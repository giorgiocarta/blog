# Welcome to my first blog post!

This is some *sample* content for my blog.

Here's a list:
- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

And here's a code block to test Pygments highlighting:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
```

## Mermaid Diagram

Here is a sample Mermaid diagram:

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Start] --> B{Is it?};
    B -- Yes --> C[OK];
    C --> D[End];
    B -- No --> E[Not OK];
    E --> D[End];
```
